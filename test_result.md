# Testing Protocol

## Communication with Testing Sub-Agent

### Backend Testing Protocol
- Test all API endpoints with proper data
- Verify database connections
- Check authentication flows
- Test file upload functionality
- Validate error handling

### Frontend Testing Protocol  
- Test user interface interactions
- Verify API integrations
- Check responsive design
- Test image upload and camera functionality
- Validate user flows

### Important Notes
- Always read this file before invoking testing agents
- Update this file with test results after each testing session
- Do not modify the Testing Protocol section above

    message: "Completed initial backend API testing. The core authentication and user management endpoints are working correctly. However, the food analysis endpoint is failing due to an invalid Gemini API key. Also found minor issues with error handling for invalid login and nonexistent user endpoints."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "The Gemini API key in backend/.env appears to be invalid. According to research, this could be due to: 1) The key format is incorrect or contains extra characters, 2) The key has API restrictions that prevent it from accessing the Generative Language API, 3) The key needs to be regenerated, or 4) The key hasn't been activated yet. Recommend generating a new Gemini API key from the Google Cloud Console and updating the backend/.env file."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Fixed the error handling issues for invalid login and nonexistent user endpoints. The API now correctly returns 401 for invalid credentials and 404 for nonexistent users. The only remaining issue is the invalid Gemini API key, which needs to be replaced with a valid one."
